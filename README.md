# Numptons

Useful laptop AutoHotkey scripts turning your keyboard into a **Nump**ad and mouse but**tons** among other things.

## Scripts

numptons.ahk (also available as a .exe): When Capslock is active, certain keys will act as mouse buttons and number keys.

swipe.ahk: Let's you swipe with four fingers to switch virtual desktops on Windows 10 (like on MacOS). I found this script somewhere in a forum that got deleted unfortunately.

## Installation

To use AutoHotkey scripts you first need to install AutoHotkey (Windows only). Afterwards you can manually start the script by opening the .ahk file or you can copy the .ahk file into your autostart folder, so Windows runs the script when you start your PC.

.exe files can be used without having AutoHotkey installed, it still only works on Windows though afaik.
